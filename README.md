## Introduction

This project aims to analyze various spatial factors to determine the most suitable locations for opening new retail stores. The analysis includes the examination of population density, income levels, and competition in the area.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* geopandas
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Installation

```
python main.py
```

## Final Thoughts
This is mostly to showcase some of my techincal capabilities to job applicants, but feel free to clone and use this if it is at all helpful to anyone mapping locations. Other than the data, the rest of the notebook should work as long as the data is formatted properly.
